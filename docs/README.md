# Introduction
Our project, WYM - Wear Your Mask, is a live application that utilizes camera recording to monitor the surrounding and determine if any individuals are maskless or not wearing their masks properly.

# Components
## Collect images (1)
* Find images and datasets online of people wearing masks, without masks, or wearing masks improperly
* Store in S3 bucket
## Bounding Box Task (1)
* Provide images to MTurk workers to draw bounding boxes around faces of visible people
## Crop Images (2)
* Using the bounding box data collected from workers, resize and crop images to fit the bounding box size in order to get closer pictures of faces
* Write python code to automatically crop images based on bounding box data
* Approve bounding box if all cropped images contain entire face and clear
## Label Task (2) 
* Create MTurk HIT for workers to label the newly cropped pictures as Wearing Mask Correctly, Wearing Mask Incorrectly, or Not Wearing Mask.
* Design html template to allow workers to label multiple images at once, including quality control images
## Quality Control (2)
* Use gold standard labels for certain images in order to conduct a quality check on the workerâ€™s labels
* Have workers label multiple images at once with a couple prelabeled images mixed in
* Write python code to compute worker quality based on gold standard labels
## Aggregate Labels (2)
* Use EM in conjunction with gold standard labels performance as initial worker quality to generate true label for each image
* Write code to generate true labels using Expectation Maximization algorithm along with gold standard labels
## Train a Classifier (3)
* Using the labels determined by the workers, train a classifier to automatically determine whether or not a face in an image is Wearing Mask Correctly, Wearing Mask Incorrectly, or Not Wearing Mask.
## Analyze Accuracy (3)
* Split the data into train/test/validation sets and run the classifier to compute accuracy
* Fine tune parameters to increase accuracy
* Test model on random pictures taken to evaluate if model is good enough in a realtime setting
## Web Application (4)
* Allow users to turn on camera for live recording
* Feed camera recording into our classifier to determine if people in the recording are wearing masks properly
* Display classifier results back to the user
# Data
## Quality Control
### Input
Dataframe result from our Image Labeling HIT task with the following columns:
* WorkerId: Id of the worker who completed the task
* Input.image(1-6): Image url of images we want workers to classify
* Input.wmc_qc: Image url of wearing mask correctly quality control image
* Input.wmi_qc: Image url of wearing mask incorrectly quality control image

## Future Considerations
We have implemented the full version of our quality control and aggregation modules. We utilize gold standard labels to get an initial quality control check for our EM algorithm to start on. We then let our algorithm converge to receive our labels. That being said, for our final labels that we use to train our classifier, we will cross reference multiple versions of our algorithm and see if they match. For any inconsistencies, we will manually verify the classification label. We expect that there will be few inconsistencies since it should fairly obviously whether a person is wearing their mask correctly or not. In other words, we expect little variance in the data. The versions of our algorithm that we will cross-reference are as follows:
* Converged EM with gold standard label performance as initial quality
* Converged EM with assuming all workers are initially perfect
* Majority vote: EM assuming all workers are initially perfect for 1 iteration
* Weighted majority vote: EM with gold standard label performance as initial quality for 1 iteration
